# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Use AWS Serverless Architecture

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, Development Team

### Context
We need to build a scalable, cost-effective invoice processing system that can handle variable workloads and integrate with AI/ML services.

### Decision
We will use AWS serverless architecture with Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB.

### Rationale
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use pricing model aligns with variable workloads
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling without infrastructure management
- **Integration**: Native integration with AWS AI services (Textract, Bedrock)
- **Maintenance**: Reduced operational overhead

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Lower operational costs, automatic scaling, faster development
- **Negative**: Vendor lock-in, cold start latency, debugging complexity
- **Neutral**: Learning curve for serverless patterns

## ADR-002: Hybrid AI/ML Extraction Strategy

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, AI Team

### Context
Invoice processing requires both speed and accuracy. Pure rule-based systems are fast but limited, while AI-only approaches are expensive and slower.

### Decision
Implement a hybrid approach using rule-based extraction first, enhanced by AI when needed.

### Rationale
- **Cost Optimization**: Use expensive AI services only when necessary
- **Performance**: Rule-based extraction is faster for common patterns
- **Accuracy**: AI enhancement handles complex or unusual invoice formats
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if AI services are unavailable

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Optimal cost/performance balance, high reliability
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in extraction logic
- **Neutral**: Need to maintain both rule sets and AI prompts

## ADR-003: Use Amazon Bedrock with Claude Models

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, AI Team

### Context
We need an AI service for intelligent field extraction from invoice text with good accuracy and reasonable cost.

### Decision
Use Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3 Haiku as the primary model, with Claude 3 Sonnet as fallback for complex documents.

### Rationale
- **Integration**: Native AWS service with good Lambda integration
- **Cost**: Claude 3 Haiku offers good performance at lower cost
- **Accuracy**: Claude models excel at structured data extraction
- **Compliance**: AWS-managed service meets security requirements

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Good accuracy, managed service, cost-effective
- **Negative**: Dependency on specific model availability
- **Neutral**: Need to monitor model performance and costs

## ADR-004: Use DynamoDB for Invoice Data Storage

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, Backend Team

### Context
We need a database to store extracted invoice data with fast read/write performance and flexible schema.

### Decision
Use Amazon DynamoDB as the primary data store for processed invoice results.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Single-digit millisecond latency
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Integration**: Native AWS service with Lambda integration
- **Schema Flexibility**: NoSQL structure accommodates varying invoice formats

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High performance, automatic scaling, serverless
- **Negative**: Limited query capabilities, eventual consistency
- **Neutral**: Need to design partition keys carefully

## ADR-005: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, Development Team

### Context
AI/ML services can fail or be throttled, and we need robust error handling for production reliability.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive error handling with retry logic, circuit breakers, and dead letter queues.

### Rationale
- **Reliability**: Graceful handling of service failures
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages and retry guidance
- **Observability**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Cost Control**: Prevent infinite retry loops

### Consequences
- **Positive**: High system reliability, better debugging
- **Negative**: Increased code complexity
- **Neutral**: Need to tune retry parameters based on usage patterns

## ADR-006: Use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, DevOps Team

### Context
We need reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure deployment across multiple environments.

### Decision
Use Terraform for all infrastructure provisioning and management.

### Rationale
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent deployments across environments
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Modularity**: Reusable modules for different components
- **State Management**: Centralized state management

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent deployments, infrastructure versioning
- **Negative**: Learning curve, state management complexity
- **Neutral**: Need to establish Terraform best practices

## ADR-007: Implement Multi-Environment Strategy

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, DevOps Team

### Context
We need separate environments for development, staging, and production with appropriate configurations.

### Decision
Implement dev, staging, and production environments with environment-specific configurations.

### Rationale
- **Risk Management**: Test changes before production deployment
- **Cost Control**: Different resource configurations per environment
- **Security**: Isolated environments with appropriate access controls
- **Development Workflow**: Support for feature development and testing

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Reduced production risk, better testing
- **Negative**: Increased infrastructure costs and complexity
- **Neutral**: Need to maintain environment parity

## ADR-008: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Daniel Amanyi, DevOps Team

### Context
We need automated testing, building, and deployment pipeline integrated with our Git workflow.

### Decision
Use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### Rationale
- **Integration**: Native GitHub integration with repository

### Decision
Implement comprehensive cost monitoring with budgets, alerts, and automated controls.

### Rationale
- **Cost Control**: Prevent unexpected cost spikes
- **Visibility**: Clear understanding of cost drivers
- **Optimization**: Data-driven cost optimization decisions
- **Governance**: Automated enforcement of spending limits

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Predictable costs, early warning system
- **Negative**: Additional monitoring complexity
