# AI/ML Implementation Details

## Real AI/ML Services Used

This project now implements **real AI/ML capabilities** using AWS serverless services:

### 1. AWS Textract (OCR)
- **Purpose**: Extract text and structured data from invoice images/PDFs
- **Features Used**:
  - Document text detection
  - Form data extraction (key-value pairs)
  - Table detection and extraction
  - Confidence scoring
- **Cost**: Pay-per-page (~$0.0015 per page for AnalyzeDocument)

### 2. Amazon Bedrock (AI Inference)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent extraction of invoice fields using LLMs
- **Model Used**: Claude 3 Haiku (cost-optimized)
- **Features**:
  - Vendor name extraction
  - Amount and currency detection
  - Date parsing and normalization
  - Invoice number identification
- **Cost**: Pay-per-token (~$0.00025 per 1K input tokens)

### 3. Hybrid Approach
The system uses a **hybrid extraction strategy**:

1. **Rule-based extraction** (fast, reliable for common patterns)
2. **AI enhancement** (handles complex/unusual formats)
3. **Result validation and merging**

## Extracted Data Fields

The system extracts the following structured data:

```json
{
  "vendor": "Company Name Inc.",
  "amount": 1234.56,
  "date": "2024-03-15",
  "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001",
  "tax_amount": 123.45,
  "currency": "USD",
  "line_items": [
    {
      "description": "Consulting Services",
      "amount": 1000.00
    }
  ],
  "extraction_method": "hybrid_ai_rules",
  "confidence": "high",
  "textract_confidence": 95.2
}
```

## Cost Optimization Features

1. **Conditional AI Usage**: Bedrock is only called for high-quality extractions
2. **Token Limiting**: Text is truncated to control AI costs
3. **Efficient Model Selection**: Uses Claude 3 Haiku (cheapest option)
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Falls back to rule-based extraction if AI fails

## Supported File Formats

- PDF documents
- PNG images
- JPEG images
- TIFF images
- BMP images

## Testing

Run local tests to validate extraction logic:

```bash
cd lambda/inference_handler
python test_local.py
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Textract Processing**: ~2-5 seconds per document
- **AI Enhancement**: ~1-3 seconds (when enabled)
- **Total Processing Time**: ~3-8 seconds per invoice
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% for standard invoice formats

## Cost Estimates (per 1000 invoices)

- **Textract**: ~$1.50 (1 page per invoice)
- **Bedrock**: ~$0.50 (assuming 2K tokens per invoice)
- **Lambda**: ~$0.10 (execution time)
- **DynamoDB**: ~$0.05 (storage)
- **Total**: ~$2.15 per 1000 invoices

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- Unsupported file format detection
- Textract service errors
- Bedrock API failures
- Confidence scoring and validation
- Graceful fallbacks to rule-based extraction

## Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:

- Processing success rate
- Extraction confidence scores
- AI vs rule-based usage ratio
- Cost per invoice processed
- Processing latency
